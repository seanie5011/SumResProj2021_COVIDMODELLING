Code for the COVID Modelling Project for Summer 2021
Sean O Riordan

This Repository contains all the .py files used in the UCC Department of Physics Project: Modelling of Epidemic Spreading.
As the project goes on, more files are added usually of more complex models.
All code created in Visual Studio 2019, a Virtual Enviroment containing PyDSTool, NumPy, and SciPy was used.

Special thanks to Dr. Bryan Kelleher, supervisor of this project.
